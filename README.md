This project joins census tract data to Philadelphia precinct data, enabling us to estimate precinct data based on its nearest census tract.

Install dependencies from `requirements.txt` then run `python3 main4.py` to perform the join.

Census shape files and precinct shape files from data.pa.gov must both be present.
